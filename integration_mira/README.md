There are a few steps here at the start to get a more biologically relevant HVG list
Quick summary:
1. Load in a list of mouse TF
2. Load data and only keep TFs
3. Determine HVG and save list
4. Load the data again and remove the TFs
5. Determine top 500 HVG
6. Combine top 500 HVG with TF HVG and run MIRA for integration
