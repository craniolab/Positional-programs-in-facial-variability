The notebooks might be a little hard to follow. The gist of them is as follows:
1. Load data
2. Integrate if there are different samples
3. Subset mesenchyme and ectoderm
4. Recluster mesenchyme and ectoderm
5. Annotate clusters based on marker genes
6. In mesenchyme, after E10.5, subset and subcluster to annotate at a higher resolution
